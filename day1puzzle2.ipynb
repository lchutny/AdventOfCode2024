    "# Problem Statement and Example\n",
    "This time, you'll need to figure out exactly how often each number from the left list appears in the right list. Calculate a total similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list.\n",

    "4   3  \n",
    "2   5  \n",
    "1   3  \n",
    "3   9  \n",
    "3   3  \n",
    "For these example lists, here is the process of finding the similarity score:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first number in the left list is 3. It appears in the right list three times, so the similarity score increases by 3 * 3 = 9.\n",
    "* The second number in the left list is 4. It appears in the right list once, so the similarity score increases by 4 * 1 = 4.\n",
    "*  The third number in the left list is 2. It does not appear in the right list, so the similarity score does not increase (2 * 0 = 0).\n",
    "* The fourth number, 1, also does not appear in the right list.\n",
    "* The fifth number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score increases by 9.\n",
    "* The last number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score again increases by 9.\n",
    "* So, for these example lists, the similarity score at the end of this process is 31 (9 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again consider your left and right lists. What is their similarity score?"
